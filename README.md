# RdrOleDll4-Client
------------
### Demonstrates the usage of RrdOleDll4 in a 64-bit C#-App (Console Application)
### Needs to tweak the registry to support a surrogate process where the RdrOleDll4-Dll is hosted in a 32-bit environment
### Registry amendments documented (as .reg file) in "RdrOle4-ReaderServer-Reg-V1.reg"
